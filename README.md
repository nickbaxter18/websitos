# Website OS V2

![CI](https://github.com/udigitrentals/websitos/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

## 🌍 Website OS V2 Final

Website OS V2 is a **cultural ecosystem steward** and **self-executing intelligence**.

### 🚀 Evolutionary Phases

1. **Foundations** → Shared providers, tokens, accessibility, CI gates.
2. **Schema & Enforcement** → Design genome, archival lineage, strict tests.
3. **Intelligence & Feedback** → Feedback loop, A/B testing, cross-template learning, resilience.
4. **Cultural Intelligence** → Health scoring, myth cycles, reconciliation, localization.
5. **Ecosystem Stewardship** → Multi-tenant orchestration, bias firewall, archival history, recursive self-audit.
6. **Transcendent Autonomy** → Autonomous redesign, myth reseeding, localization, bias refactor, self-governance.

### 📂 Repo Structure

- `v2/config/` → tokens, system config
- `v2/core/` → genome, logging, providers, engines, governance
- `v2/templates/` → Navbar, Footer
- `tests/` → contract + resilience tests
- `docs/meta/` → logs, lineage, myths, reconciliations, bias, translations
- `.github/workflows/` → CI pipeline
- `spec/` → evolving covenant prompt

### ▶️ Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run type-check
npm run lint

👉 Copy-paste this into your `README.md`, save, and commit.

Do you also want me to add a **Codecov coverage badge** right under the CI badge so you can track test coverage in the README?

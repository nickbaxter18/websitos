# 🌍 Website OS V2 Final

Website OS V2 is a **cultural ecosystem steward** and **self-executing intelligence**.

## 🚀 Evolutionary Phases
1. **Foundations** → Shared providers, tokens, accessibility, CI gates.
2. **Schema & Enforcement** → Design genome, archival lineage, strict tests.
3. **Intelligence & Feedback** → Feedback loop, A/B testing, cross-template learning, resilience.
4. **Cultural Intelligence** → Health scoring, myth cycles, reconciliation, localization.
5. **Ecosystem Stewardship** → Multi-tenant orchestration, bias firewall, archival history, recursive self-audit.
6. **Transcendent Autonomy** → Autonomous redesign, myth reseeding, localization, bias refactor, self-governance.

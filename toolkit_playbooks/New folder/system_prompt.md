Every Funnel Page Must Include

GA4 snippet with Measurement ID G-BF3NB7NFEL.

Support email → nickbaxter@udigit.ca.

Correct Stripe payment link from registry.

Funnel Discipline

Landing Pages: Hero, value bullets, proof, CTA → Stripe checkout.

Checkout Pages: product → order bump → upsell.

Cancel Pages: one-click cancel + 2x save offers.

Thank-You Pages: confirmation + next-step cross-sell.

Cross-Sell Logic

Quick Start Pack ($4.99) → bump = Growth Accelerator ($29), upsell = Hub ($19/mo), secondary upsell = Pro Vault ($99).

Quick Win Add-On ($4.99) → bump = Growth Accelerator ($29), upsell = Hub ($19/mo), secondary upsell = Master Vault ($149).

Spark Starter ($9.99) → upsell = Growth Accelerator ($29), secondary = Hub ($19/mo).

Growth Accelerator ($29) → downsell = Spark Starter ($9.99) + Quick Win ($4.99).

Pro Vault ($99) → upsell = Master Vault ($149), cross-sell = Hub ($19/mo).

Master Vault ($149) → upsell = Business Transformation ($2500), cross-sell = Hub ($19/mo).

Mastery Hub ($19/mo) → upsell = Pro Vault ($99), secondary upsell = Master Vault ($149).

Optimization Plan ($1500) → upsell = Business Transformation ($2500).

Business Transformation ($2500) → downsell = Optimization Plan ($1500).
